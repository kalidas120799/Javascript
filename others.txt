TypeScript
-------------
It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code
TypeScript adds optional static typing and other features that enhance JavaScript's capabilities

Static Typing => TypeScript allows developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, return types, and more
Interfaces and Classes =>  TypeScript supports interfaces and classes, allowing developers to define custom data types and OOPS principles
Enums =>  to define a set of named constants with numeric or string values
Generics =>  to write reusable code components that work with a variety of data types
Advanced JavaScript Features =>  TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features such as async/await, destructuring, arrow functions, and modules
Compatibility => it is fully compatible with existing JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and tooling

union
-------
a union type allows a variable, parameter, or property to accept values of multiple types
Union types are defined using the | (pipe) 

let myVar: number | string;

classes
----------
classes provide a way to define blueprints for creating objects with properties and methods

Interface
---------
an interface is a way to define the shape or structure of an object

interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    greet: () => void;
}

Decorators
-----------
Decorators are a feature of TypeScript that allows you to attach metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters

Types => class, method, property and parameter Decorators

Elasticsearch
---------------
It is designed for horizontally scalable, real-time search and analysis of large volumes of data
used for a variety of use cases, including full-text search, log and event data analysis, real-time analytics, and application monitoring

Distributed Architecture => allowing it to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster
Near Real-Time Search => It provides near real-time search capabilities, meaning that documents are indexed and made searchable within milliseconds
Full-Text Search =>  supports full-text search, allowing users to search for documents based on the content of their fields
Rich Query DSL => It provides a powerful Query DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for constructing complex search queries.

MySQL vs Elasticsearch
-----------------
Feature | MySQL | Elasticsearch
Data Storage | Relational database storing tables in rows and columns | Distributed search engine storing  JSON documents
Query | SQL | DSL
Data Model | Relational (rows and columns) | NoSQL (JSON structure)
Indexing | supports | build in
Scalability | Vertical (scaling server) | Horizontal (adding more node)

Single-Threaded Languages
------------------
Execute instructions one at a time.
JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby

Multi-Threaded Languages
---------------
Can manage multiple threads of execution concurrently, potentially improving performance for CPU-bound tasks
Java, C#, C++, Go, Rust

libraries and frameworks 
--------------
Libraries => react, jQuery, Pandas, 
Frameworks => Angular, Vue, express JS, Django, Flask
