MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system 

Database Management System (DBMS) => A DBMS is a software application that allows you to organize, store, and retrieve data in a structured way
Relational Database =>  data is stored in separate tables related to each other
MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language), a standardized language for interacting with relational databases. This allows you to easily add, access, update, and delete data using commands

MySQL clustering
--------------
refers to the practice of using multiple MySQL servers to distribute the workload and provide high 
availability and scalability for database applications.

MySQL Replication
----------
data is replicated from a primary (master) MySQL server to one or more secondary (slave) servers

MySQL Router
-----------
MySQL Router is a lightweight middleware component that provides transparent routing between client applications and a MySQL Cluster

SELECT statement in MySQL?
---------------
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a MySQL database

normalization?
-------------
Normalization is the process of organizing a relational database's structure to reduce data redundancy, 
improve data integrity, and optimize its performance

MySQL data types
-----------
Numeric Types => INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, DOUBLE
String Data Types => CHAR(M), VARCHAR(M), TEXT(65535), BINARY, BLOB(65535)
Date and Time Data Types => DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP
Other Data Types => ENUM(value1,value2), SET(value1,value2), BOOLEAN

CHAR vs TEXT data type
---------------
Feature | CHAR | TEXT data type
Max Length | up to 255 | up to 65,535(64kb)
Storage size| fixed | Variable
Performance | faster | slower for retrieval and sorting.
Indexing | can be | Can't be

BIGINT => 8 byte signed(-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807), unsigned( 0 to 18446744073709551615 )

MySQL vs SQL
------------
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
MySQL, on the other hand, is one of the many relational database management systems that support SQL

SQL provides a standardized way to interact with databases
MySQL is known for being fast, reliable, and easy to use

SQL commands
-------------
DDL (Data Definition Language) => used to define, modify, and delete the structure of database objects
CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, COMMENT

DML (Data Manipulation Language) => used to manage the data within the database
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DCL (Data Control Language) => used to grant or revoke privileges and permissions to users and roles
GRANT, REVOKE

MySQL binary log
-----------
The MySQL binary log is a log file that records all changes to the database, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, as well as DDL statements

query in MySQL?
---------
A query in MySQL is a request for information from a database using SQL
It typically involves selecting, inserting, updating, or deleting data from database 

CREATE TABLE ExampleTable (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    varchar_col VARCHAR(255),
    char_col CHAR(10),
    int_col INT,
    bigint_col BIGINT,
    tinyint_col TINYINT,
    smallint_col SMALLINT,
    float_col FLOAT,
    double_col DOUBLE,
    decimal_col DECIMAL(10,2),
    date_col DATE,
    datetime_col DATETIME,
    timestamp_col TIMESTAMP,
    time_col TIME,
    year_col YEAR,
    text_col TEXT,
    blob_col BLOB,
    enum_col ENUM('Option1', 'Option2', 'Option3'),
    set_col SET('Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3')
);
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';
UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE Department = 'Sales';
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Age > 60;
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN ManagerID INT after Salary;

database schema?
------------
A database schema is the blueprint or skeleton structure that represents the logical configuration of a database
It defines the organization and relationships between tables, as well as the columns, data types, constraints,
indexes, and other elements that comprise the database

primary key vs unique key
----------------
Feature | primary key | unique key
Purpose | each record uniquely in a table |  uniqueness of values in a column
Allowed | Only one per table | multiple key per table
Null Values | Does not allow | Allows NULL values but only one null per column
Relationship | repeatedly used as a foreign key | Can be used as a foreign key

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY, // id is primary key
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE, // email is unique key
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

composite primary key
-----------
A composite primary key is a combination of two or more columns that 
uniquely identifies each row in a database table

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID)
);

foreign key constraint?
-------------
A foreign key constraint is a rule, connection between two tables in a relational database
the values in a column in one table match the values in a column in another table

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

Joins
-------
Joins in MySQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them

INNER JOIN
----------
Returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables

SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) 
--------------------
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
If there are no matches, NULL values are used.

SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
-----------------
Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
If there are no matches, NULL values are used.

SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
--------------
Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. 
It returns all rows from both tables and NULL values for unmatched rows

SELECT * FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

cross join?
-----------
A CROSS JOIN in MySQL returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning 
it combines each row of the first table with every row of the second table

SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;

Null value
-----------
Represents the absence of a value in a column
indicates column is missing, unknown, or undefined.
NULL + 1 = NULL

Zero value
--------
Represents the numeric value 0
indicates specific numeric quantity
0 + 1 = 1

database transaction?
-----------
A database transaction is a logical work, that includes one or more database activities
It is a technique for combining many database operations into a single

subquery 
----------
A subquery, also known as a nested query, is a query nested within another query
It's used to retrieve data based on the results of another query.

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID IN 
(SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA');

correlated subquery?
----------
A correlated subquery is a type of subquery that depends on the outer query for its execution

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees e WHERE Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary)
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Department = e.Department
);

LIKE operator in MySQL?
--------------
The LIKE operator in MySQL is used to search for a specified pattern within a column.

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';

self-join in MySQL?
----------
A self-join in MySQL is when a table is joined with itself
This can be useful for comparing rows within the same table

SELECT e1.EmployeeID, e1.FirstName, e1.ManagerID, e2.FirstName AS ManagerName
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;

stored procedure in MySQL
-------------
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that is stored in the database and can be executed multiple times
used to execute a sequence of SQL statements on the server side

call a stored procedure in MySQL?
--------------
Stored procedures can be called using the CALL statement

advantages of using stored procedures?
-------------
Improved performance, business logic 
Enhanced security by restricting direct access to tables

function in mysql
--------------
a function is a stored program that returns a single value based on the input parameters provided.
it's do specific operation or calculation in the SQL statements

Built-in Functions => CONCAT, ROUND, DATE_FORMAT, LENGTH
User-defined Functions => function created by users

stored procedures vs functions 
--------------
Feature | stored procedures | functions 
Invocation | using the CALL statement | SQL queries or other expressions
Return Value | zero or more output | a single value
Usage | used for executing a sequence of SQL | used for calculations
Error Handling | can handle error | Limited error handling
