continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)

GitHub Actions?
----------
GitHub Actions enables users to automate various GitHub events, such as cloning a repository, generating Docker images, and testing scripts
Developers use it to automate workflows across issues, pull requests. This means that users can build, test, and deploy code

How do GitHub Actions work?
------------
GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows. These YAML files are stored in a .github/workflows
Each workflow consists of one or more jobs, and each job consists of one or more steps.

benefits to using GitHub Actions
-------------------
Simplified workflows, Supports a wide range of platforms and languages, Secure, Cost-effective and  Easy to get started

File path : .github/workflows/app-test-action.yml

name: Build and Test the app
on:
  push:
    branches: [master, stage]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master, stage]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x] 
 
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
 
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
 
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
 
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test

----------------------------
Trigger (on) :
-----------
Specifies when the workflow should be executed
Trigger on a push or pull request

Steps:
--------
Specify the individual tasks and run sequentially

Jobs :
---------
A workflow must have at least 1 job and can consist of multiple jobs that work together sequentially or in parallel.
Each job is a series of steps that runs under the same runner (virtual environment)

Workflow :
---------
The workflow is an automated procedure that you add to your repository.
They are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event

Runners :
---------
A runner is a server that has the GitHub Action Runner application installed
two types of runners =>  hosted and self-hosted
Hosted runners are provided by GitHub and run on virtual machines in the cloud
Self-hosted runners are machines that you set up and manage yourself.

Actions
--------
Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job

continuous deployment (CD)
-----------------
big bang deployment : Normal deployment
Rolling deployment : Step by step rollout the new changes like country wise
Blue green deployment : Blue is live server and green is dev server after everythink okay users redirect to green
Canery deployment : beta Concept to specific region
Feature taggle : taggle button use to enble new feature in to the application

best deployment Concept is Blue green deployment
